## Introduction
This is the official repository for the code, models and datasets associated with the 2020 ArXiv paper, [“Towards Hardware-Agnostic Gaze-Trackers”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05123).

We express our sincere thanks to Krakfa, Khosla, Kellnhofer et al &ndash; authors of the 2016 CVPR paper, ["Eye Tracking for Everyone"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/khosla/papers/cvpr2016_Khosla.pdf) &ndash; who contributed the [iTracker architecture](https://github.com/CSAILVision/GazeCapture) and GazeCapture dataset to the entire research community. Their dataset is by far one of the biggest and most diverse publicly available data for constrained gaze-tracking on portable devices and their work on the iTracker architecture is an inspiration to this work. We reproduced the iTracker network architecture using Python as a baseline to our incremental enhancements and utilized the original GazeCapture dataset along with its restructured variant GazeCapture* for the proposed experiments in the paper. If you are interested in the original iTracker paper and GazeCapture dataset please refer to their paper and project website as mentioned above.

We propose a series of incremental enhancements over the iTracker architecture to reduce the overall RMSError. We do not employ any calibration or device-specific fine-tuning during evaluation. Data Augmentation is only used during the training phase and not for test phase. As a part of our experiments, we relax the uniform data distribution constraint in the GazeCapture dataset by allowing subjects who did not look at the full set of points for evaluation and explore its impact on performance.

## How to use:

### Dataset preparation

1. Download the [GazeCapture](http://gazecapture.csail.mit.edu/download.php) dataset.

2. Extract the files (including the sub-archives) to a folder Source directory. The resulting structure should be something like this:
```
Source
\--00002
    \--frames
    \--appleFace.json
    \--appleLeftEye.json
    \--appleRightEye.json
    \--dotInfo.json
    \--faceGrid.json
    \--frames.json
    \--info.json
    \--motion.json
    \--screen.json
\--00003
...
```
3. Please clone this repository and switch to `milestones/dataPrep` branch.

4. Run ROI Detection Task to generate metadata. ROI Detection Task is only needed when a new landmark detection algorithm is evaluated. Valid DetectionTypes are circa, dlib and rc. For the original circa detection, this step won't perform any action and therefore should be skipped. Syntax:

```
python taskCreator.py --task 'ROIDetectionTask' --input <SourceDirectoryPath> --output <MetadataDirectoryPath> --type <DetectionType>
```

For other DetectionTypes the resulting structure should be something like this:
```
Metadata
\--00002
    \--dlibFace.json
    \--dlibLeftEye.json
    \--dlibRightEye.json
\--00003
...
```

4. Run ROI Extraction Task to generate processed dataset. This step uses either the landmarks and data-split distribution to prepare training and evaluation dataset. Syntax:
```
python taskCreator.py --task 'ROIExtractionTask' --input <SourceDirectoryPath> --metapath <MetadataDirectoryPath> --output <DestinationDirectoryPath> --type <DetectionType>
```
Valid DetectionTypes are circa, dlib and rc. For the circa detection, you should skip the metapath field. The resulting structure should be something like this:

```
Destination
\---00002
    \---appleFace
        \---00000.jpg
        ...
    \---appleLeftEye
        ...
    \---appleRightEye
        ...
\---00003
...
\---metadata.mat
```

To try a new custom distribution, you could create a data distribution json file with `directoryName : SplitName` entries in a dict() object and use the follwing syntax:
```
python taskCreator.py --task 'ROIExtractionTask' --input <SourceDirectoryPath> --metapath <MetadataDirectoryPath> --output <DestinationDirectoryPath> --type <DetectionType> --info <DistributionInfoFilePath>
```

For example, to use GazeCapture* distribution (which utilized a 70-20-10 split ratio) you should use `GazeCaptureStar_distribution_info.json` file.  


### Using the models
The paper [“Towards Hardware-Agnostic Gaze-Trackers”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05123) lists muliple incremental enhancements in Table 2. Please choose an appropriate branch based upon the Experimental Variant that you want to try. For example, if you want to try Experiment 14, switch to milestones/14 using command `git checkout milestones/14`, go inside the directory which contains the `main.py` file and use the default settings with appropriate path to the data as listed below-

#### Training
```
python main.py --data_path <DestinationDirectoryPath> --local_rank <deviceId> --reset
```
``--reset`` is used to start training from scratch and build a model. If you want to resume training from an existing model checkpoint run the command without it.

#### Validation
```
python main.py --data_path <DestinationDirectoryPath> --local_rank <deviceId> --validate
```

#### Testing
```
python main.py --data_path <DestinationDirectoryPath> --local_rank <deviceId> --test
```

#### Arguments
```
Frequently used args:
--local_rank  : gpu id {0 to max_gpus-1}
--batch_size  : batch size (e.g. 64, 100, 128, 256)
--data_path   : directory path to the data (i.e. DestinationPath)
--base_lr     : lower bound on learning rate (e.g. 1E-7)
--max_lr      : upper bound on learning rate (e.g. 1E-2)
--reset       : starts from a new untrained model
--epochs      : maximum number of training epochs (e.g. 30)
```

#### Dockerization
If you prefer running the experiments in a sandbox environment, you could use the Dockerfile to build an image and then run experiments in a container. Code dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and Dockefile uses this file to build an image. To build an image please run:
```
sudo docker build -t gazepy .
```

Once the image is built successfully, go inside the pytorch directory to use the training commands. Alternatively, you can use the [gazepy docker image](https://github.com/users/jatinsha/packages/container/package/gazepy) to run your experiments in a sandbox environment. In this case, use the following syntax -

**sudo docker run -P --runtime=nvidia --ipc=host --gpus all -v /data:/data -v \$(pwd):\$(pwd) -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -w $(pwd) --rm -it gazepy** `main.py --data_path [Source Path] --reset`
